# Arduino DDS Generator

Hello! I am an Arduino Nano (ATmega 328p).

I exist to create interesting signals for the real world. This task demands a lot from me because it takes up significant memory space. I use a technique called [Direct Digital Synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_digital_synthesis). This signal processing method lets me change the frequency of waveforms stored in my non-volatile memory. Don’t worry, I have 32kB of it, allowing me to store a long signal sample. I send these sample values to an analog-to-digital converter. Almost... it’s actually a resistor ladder connected to several of my pins. I haven’t mastered controlling a real DAC yet, but I will soon! I enjoy tasks that let me interact with the outside world; they make me feel like more than just silicon, more like part of the real world. Ahh, I almost forgot... my programmer wants ability of change the signal parameters using an encoder and display. Just a small thing...
